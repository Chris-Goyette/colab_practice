# colab_practice

## What:
- The colab_practice directory is currently being used as the central repository for all colab notebooks that I am using to learn and practice python/colab.  

## Why: 
- I am documenting my journey as a data analyst and plan to save notebooks here as I develop my skills.
- Having a central location for all my practice notebooks will help me if I ever get stuck by allowing me to reference my notes and documentation.
- This repo could also serve as a reference/guide to other new data analysts who are entering the field. 
- Displaying my work here will also allow me to measure my progress. 

## Where: 
- Click on the [notbooks](https://github.com/Chris-Goyette/colab_practice/tree/main/notebooks) directory to see the various practice colab notebooks.
